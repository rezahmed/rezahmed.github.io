<p> Abstract: We introduce the simple and efficient method of monotonic abstraction to prove safety properties for parameterized systems with linear topologies. A process in the system is a finite-state automaton, where the transitions are guarded by both local and global conditions. Processes may communicate via broadcast, rendez-vous and shared variables over finite domains. The method of monotonic abstraction derives an over-approximation of the induced transition system that allows the use of a simple class of regular expressions as a symbolic representation. Compared to traditional regular model checking methods, the analysis does not require the manipulation of transducers, and hence its simplicity and efficiency. We have implemented a prototype that works well on several mutual exclusion algorithms and cache coherence protocols </p>
