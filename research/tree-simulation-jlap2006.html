<p> Abstract: Regular model checking is the name of a family of techniques for analyzing infinite-state systems in which states are represented by words, sets of states by finite automata, and transitions by finite-state transducers. In this framework, the central problem is to compute the transitive closure of a transducer. Such a representation allows to compute the set of reachable states of the system and to detect loops between states. A main obstacle of this approach is that there exists many systems for which the reachable set of states is not regular. Recently, regular model checking has been extended to systems with tree-like architectures. In this paper, we provide a procedure, based on a new implementable acceleration technique, for computing the transitive closure of a tree transducer. The procedure consists of incrementally adding new transitions while merging states, which are related according to a pre-defined equivalence relation. The equivalence is induced by a downward and an upward simulation relation, which can be efficiently computed. Our technique can also be used to compute the set of reachable states without computing the transitive closure. We have implemented and applied our technique to various protocols. </p>
