<h3>Monotonic Abstraction in Action</h3>
  
<p>Authors: Parosh Aziz Abdulla, Giorgio Delzanno, <a href="www.ahmedrezine.com">Ahmed Rezine</a></p>

<p> Abstract: We consider verification of safety properties for parameterized distributed protocols. Such a protocol consists of an arbitrary number of (infinite-state) processes that communicate asynchronously over FIFO channels. The aim is to perform parameterized verification, i.e., showing correctness regardless of the number of processes inside the system. We consider two non-trivial case studies: the distributed Lamport and Ricart-Agrawala mutual exclusion protocols. We adapt the method of monotonic abstraction that considers an over-approximation of the system, in which the behavior is monotonic with respect to a given pre-order on the set of configurations. We report on an implementation which is able to fully automatically verify mutual exclusion for both protocols. </p>
