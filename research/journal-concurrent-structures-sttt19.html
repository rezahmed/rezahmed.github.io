<p> Abstract: We present a technique for automatically verify- ing
safety properties of concurrent programs, in particular programs which
rely on subtle dependencies of local states of different threads, such
as lock-free implementations of stacks and queues in an environment
without garbage collection. Our technique addresses the joint
challenges of infinite-state specifications, an unbounded number of
threads, and an un- bounded heap managed by explicit memory
allocation. Our technique builds on the automata-theoretic approach to
model checking, in which a specification is given by an automaton that
observes the execution of a program and accepts execu- tions that
violate the intended specification. We extend this approach by
allowing specifications to be given by a class of infinite-state
automata. We show how such automata can be used to specify queues,
stacks, and other data structures, by extending a data-independence
argument. For verification, we develop a shape analysis, which tracks
correlations be- tween pairs of threads, and a novel abstraction to
make the analysis practical. We have implemented our method and used
it to verify programs, some of which have not been verified by any
other automatic method before.
