<p> Assistant professor ("universitetslektor") at
  <a href="http://www.ida.liu.se">Link&ouml;ping University</a>.
  I look for ways to extend automated verification techniques. Interests:
    <ul>
      <li> model checking, abstract interpretation </li>
      <li> parameterized verification: concurrent, distributed systems </li>
      <li> shape analysis, heap manipulating programs </li>
      <li> concurrent data structures: fine grained, lock free </li>
      <li> cache coherence protocols, timing side-channel attacks</li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <p> I lead the the <a href="./ceniit-12-04/">CENIIT 12.04</a>
    research project about applying and extending automatic
    verification.
    </p>

<p> I co-investigate, with Prof.Sudipta Chattopadhyay,
	  the <a href="https://asset-group.github.io/projects/secure-embedded.html">Verification
	  and Validation of Side-channel Freedom project</a> project.
	  The project members are grateful for the generous support of
	  a highly competitive three-years grant from the Singapore
	  Ministry of Education (MOE).
    </p>
    
    <p> I am looking for clever and hard working students to carry out
    several exciting Master's and Bachelor theses.  Contact me if
    interested or want to discuss a project.
    </p>
