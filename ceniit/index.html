<h2> Context </h2>

<p>In less than a decade, concurrency and the imperative to
      parallelize have invaded almost every computer application
      domain. In fact, most commercialized computers have nowadays a
      Multicore inside and mainstream Graphical Processing Units have
      already hundreds of them. One of the main reasons for this trend
      is that processors' clock frequencies have reached their
      inevitable plateau. Future computer platforms will contain more
      and more cores, requiring more and more concurrent or parallel
      code to be produced. Harnessing the potential concurrent
      software can offer on modern platforms is both an opportunity
      and a complex challenge. </p>

<p>      Already, it is not rare to see programmers spend more time
      finding and fixing bugs in existing sequential code than they do
      writing new one. It is estimated that more than half of the
      software development costs of a typical project are spent on
      identifying and fixing defects. Software errors that remain
      uncovered can result in huge material losses or even human
      casualties. <!-- According to a study by the American National -->
      <!-- Institute for Standards and Technology, the cost of software -->
      <!-- errors to the American economy alone exceeds 59 billion dollars -->
      <!-- a year, or about 0,6 % of the US GDP. --> The ever increasing
      dependency on complex computer systems, especially for safety critical
      systems, and the inherent impossibility for testing to cover all
      scenarios have pushed big names like Microsoft and NASA to
      investigate and to gradually adopt formal methods and automatic
      verification techniques like software model checking. </p>

<h3>Goal and Vision</h3>

<p> Software verification is at a turning point, and promising results are currently being obtained by
several academic and industrial actors. This project will allow LiU to
be part of these developments and profit industrial partners from the
latest developments in the area. </p>
