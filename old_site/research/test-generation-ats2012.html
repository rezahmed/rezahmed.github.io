<p> Abstract: This paper presents a high-level automatic test instruction generation (HATIG) technical that allows, for the first time, to test the scheduling unit of an out-of-order superscalar processor. This technique leverages on existing bounded model checking tools in order to generate software- based self-testing programs from a global EFSM model of the processor under test. The experimental results have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed technique.
