<h3>Ordered Counter-Abstraction: Refinable Subword Relations
for Parameterized Verification</h3>
  
<p>Authors: Pierre Ganty, <a href="http://www.ahmedrezine.com">Ahmed Rezine</a></p>

<p> Abstract: 
We present an original refinable subword based 
symbolic representation for the verification
of linearly ordered parameterized systems. 
Such a system consists of arbitrary many finite processes placed in an array. 
Processes communicate using global transitions
constrained by their relative positions (i.e., priorities).
The model can include binary communication, broadcast, 
shared variables or dynamic creation and deletion of processes.
Configurations are finite words of arbitrary lengths.
The successful monotonic abstraction approach 
uses the subword relation to define upward closed sets as 
symbolic representations for such systems. 
Natural and automatic refinements remained missing for such symbolic
representations. 
For example, subword based relations (even in conjunction with 
constraints on resulting Parikh images) are simply too coarse 
for automatic forward verification of systems involving priorities. 
We remedy to this situation and introduce a symbolic representation based on 
an original combination of counter abstraction with subword 
based relations.
This allows us to define an infinite family of relaxation operators 
that guarantee termination by a new 
well quasi ordering argument. 
The proposed automatic analysis is
at least as precise and efficient 
as monotonic abstraction when performed backwards.
It can also be successfully used in forward, 
something monotonic abstraction is incapable of.
We implemented a prototype to illustrate the approach. </p>
