<h2>Tools</h2>

I develop(ed) a number of research prototypes. Please contact me if
you have questions about one them. More tools are to come soon!

<p> The <a href="/docs/pcw.tar.gz">PCW</a> prototype
aims at experimenting with an original adaptation of counter abstraction
for the verification of parameterized systems (see the LATA'14 "ordered
counter abstraction" paper).</p>

<p> The <a href="/docs/undip.tar.gz">UNDIP</a>
prototype enables the verification of safety properties for
<b>Un</b>bounded <b>Di</b>stributed
<b>P</b>arametreized systems. </p>
