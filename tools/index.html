<h2>Tools</h2>

I develop(ed) a number of research prototypes. Please contact me if
you have questions about one them. More tools are to come soon!

<p> The <a href="./pcw.tar.gz">PCW</a> prototype
aims at experimenting with an original adaptation of counter abstraction
for the verification of parameterized systems (see the LATA'14 "ordered
counter abstraction" paper).</p>

<p> The <a href="http://www.it.uu.se/research/docs/fm/apv/tools/undip/">UNDIP</a>
prototype enables the verification of safety properties for
<b>Un</b>bounded <b>Di</b>stributed
<b>P</b>arametreized systems. UNDIP is a generalization of
<a href="http://www.it.uu.se/research/docs/fm/apv/tools/pfs/">PFS</a> which verifies the same type of
properties for <b>P</b>arameterized <b>F</b>inite state <b>S</b>ystems.</p>
